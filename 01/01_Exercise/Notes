JSX (JS XML)

JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
JSX makes it easier to write & and HTML in React.
JSX makes it easier to visualize the structure of the UI.


Key Points:

JSX must have one parent element: Everything inside the return statement must be wrapped in a single element.

JSX is not a string or HTML: Under the hood, JSX gets converted into JavaScript functions (React.createElement) that represent HTML elements.

Self-closing tags: Just like in HTML, you can use self-closing tags like <img />, <input />, etc.
